# Automatic Identification of Bird Species
## Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems
### Project Fall 2021
We wanted to create an algorithm in order to detect a type of bird because birdwatching is a popular hobby and identifying birds is difficult to do manually. 

In this project we created a notebook which trains a model on a selfmade dataset of 20+ bird species. We used Tensorflow to create  a CNN for this.

The dataset is stored locally, and is made up of 150 jpg-images for each species on average. 

Some of the previous tests and versions for this project can be seen in the commits.
